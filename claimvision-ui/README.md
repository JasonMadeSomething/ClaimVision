# ClaimVision - Modern Disaster Claims Organization Interface

ClaimVision is a modern, intuitive disaster claims organization interface designed to help users sort and categorize photos of damaged property effortlessly. The UI is fluid, intuitive, and visually cleanâ€”more like a productivity tool than an insurance app.

## Features

- **Workbench Interface**: A primary workspace where users can freely organize their uploaded photos
- **Drag-and-Drop Functionality**: Create items by stacking related photos together
- **Room Organization**: Assign items to rooms for better organization and reduced clutter
- **Hybrid Search Modes**: 
  - "Find" mode removes non-matching photos from view
  - "Highlight" mode keeps everything visible but fades out non-matching items
- **AI Photo Labeling**: Automatically label and filter photos to help users quickly find related items
- **Item Details Panel**: View and edit item information, including associated photos, descriptions, and replacement values
- **Cached Photo Positioning**: Users don't lose their layout when switching views or filters
